## Project Summary
DekorSwap is a premium home décor subscription service that offers a curated, monthly rotation of home styling items (vases, lamps, art, etc.). The goal is to provide a "circular economy" solution for renters and design-conscious individuals, allowing them to keep their homes fresh without the clutter or financial burden of ownership.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Components:** Radix UI / Custom Styled Components
- **Typography:** Modern Sans-Serif (Geist/System)

## Architecture
- `src/app/`: Contains the main pages (`page.tsx`, `how-it-works/`, `pricing/`, `about/`, `contact/`)
- `src/components/`: Shared UI components and layout elements (Navbar, Footer)
- `src/app/globals.css`: Brand theme configuration using Tailwind 4 CSS variables

## User Preferences
- **Aesthetic:** Modern, minimalist, Scandinavian-inspired.
- **Colors:** Warm off-white (#f2f2ed), Deep charcoal (#2C2C2C), Terracotta accent (#D4745E).
- **Tone:** Premium yet approachable, sustainable, design-forward.

## Project Guidelines
- Use lots of white space and minimalist layouts.
- Prioritize high-quality, bright, and airy interior imagery.
- Ensure all pages are mobile-responsive and include smooth transitions.
- Maintain a consistent brand identity across all touchpoints.

## Common Patterns
- **Animations:** Use `framer-motion` for staggered entries and scroll-triggered reveals.
- **CTAs:** Consistent "Get Started" and "Start Your Subscription" buttons throughout.
- **Trust Signals:** Use checkmarks and badges to build credibility (avoid fake stats or testimonials).
